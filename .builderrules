# Theming

Always include the dark/light theme toggle that's on the home page whenever creating new pages.

# Component Usage

- When importing from figma, uuse components from @cloudscape-design/components package when possible
- Don't ever update existing components.  If you think updating an existing component would be helpful, put that in the summary output after building a design.
- Alert and Flashbar components are very similar in cloudscape-design. We have a strong preference to use Flashbar unless the user asks for the Alert component.

# Other Demo notes to look out for
- When changing  colors of components, check to see if there are variants of that component that you should use instead.
